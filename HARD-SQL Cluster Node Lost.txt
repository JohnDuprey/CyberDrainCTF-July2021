Flag = goodjobmaniamproudofyou 

I was able to get the SQL server back online after logging in as the domain administrator with cached credentials. I opened Failover Cluster Manager, and removed the disks. Once removed, I was able to bring them online in Disk Management and change the drive letter for the Data drive to U: to match the SQL Server Configuration. After getting past that part, I had to change the service account to Local System, disable TCP/IP protocol and use named pipes to log into the server.
